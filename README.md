# CoFactor browser extension

This browser extension [implements](https://github.com/empirical-org/CoFactor/issues/29) a Chrome extension for [CoFactor](https://github.com/empirical-org/CoFactor). It provides a one-stop popover with links to all of CoFactor's collaboration resources.

It was done as a group project for Code Montage's [Amplify Women Coders Dinner](https://www.codemontage.com/events/amplify-women-coders-dinner).
